# sudoku
opencv and tesseract python sudoku solver

Currently can find a puzzle on a page and warp the image to fit.
Tesseract doesn't work with harder to read pictures such as warped pictures (try with both sample images one will fail)
Eventually will implement a neural net for text recognition

### Credit
I took a good chunk of code from here:

*tesseract must be downloaded on the machine to run this. In windows, please follow steps to bring the tesseract .exe in*
